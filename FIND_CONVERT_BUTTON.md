## The Convert Button is ONLY in "My Tools" Tab

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Toolbox Tab**
   - Click "Toolbox" in the Mastery section

2. **Add a Tool First** (if you don't have any)
   - Make sure you're on the **"Library"** tab
   - Click the **"Add"** button on any tool
   - The tool will be added to your personal collection

3. **Switch to "My Tools" Tab**
   - Click the **"My Tools"** tab (not "Library")
   - You should see your added tools here

4. **Find the Convert Button**
   - Look for the **purple "Convert"** button
   - It's on the right side of each tool card
   - It's next to the usage count

### Visual Guide:

```
Toolbox Tab
├── Library Tab (shows all 8 tools)
│   └── [Add] button (adds to your collection)
│
└── My Tools Tab (shows YOUR tools)
    └── [Convert] button (converts to habit) ← HERE!
```

### What You Should See:

**In Library Tab:**
- 8 tools from the database
- Each has an "Add" button
- No convert button (because they're not yours yet)

**In My Tools Tab:**
- Only tools you've added
- Each has a purple "Convert" button
- Usage tracking and streak display

### If You Don't See the Convert Button:

1. ✅ Make sure you're on "My Tools" tab (not "Library")
2. ✅ Make sure you've added at least one tool from the library
3. ✅ Make sure you're logged in
4. ✅ Check if the tool is in your personal collection

### Quick Test:

1. Go to Toolbox → Library
2. Click "Add" on "Pomodoro Technique"
3. Switch to "My Tools" tab
4. You should see "Pomodoro Technique" with a purple "Convert" button

The convert button is definitely there - it's just in the "My Tools" section! 🎯
