### ✅ STEP 1: Create .env File (5 minutes)

**Choose ONE method:**

#### Option A: Automatic (Easiest!)
```bash
# Mac/Linux:
./create-env.sh

# Windows:
create-env.bat
```

#### Option B: Manual
1. Create new file named `.env` in project root
2. Copy content from `START_HERE.md` section "Create .env File"
3. Save file

**Verify:**
- [ ] File `.env` exists in project root (same level as `package.json`)
- [ ] File contains `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=...`
- [ ] File is saved

### ✅ STEP 2: Database Migrations

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - All database migrations have been successfully applied!

**What's been created:**
- ✅ **20+ tables** with proper relationships
- ✅ **4 schools** (Ignition, Insight, Transformation, God Mode)
- ✅ **Foreign key constraints** linking all tables
- ✅ **RLS policies** for security
- ✅ **Helper functions** for XP and progress tracking
- ✅ **Indexes** for performance

**Migration files:** All completed migrations are archived in `supabase/migrations/archive/`

---

### ✅ STEP 3: Verify Database (5 minutes)

**In Supabase:**

1. Click **"Table Editor"** (left sidebar)
2. Check you see these tables:
   - [ ] schools
   - [ ] constellation_families
   - [ ] constellations
   - [ ] courses
   - [ ] lessons
   - [ ] posts

3. Click on **"schools"** table
4. Verify you see **4 rows**:
   - [ ] Ignition
   - [ ] Insight
   - [ ] Transformation
   - [ ] God Mode

**All checked?** Database setup is complete! ✅

---

### ✅ STEP 4: Test Connection (5 minutes)

**Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Test 1: Check schools
SELECT * FROM schools ORDER BY order_index;
-- Should return: 4 schools

-- Test 2: Check profiles table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
-- Should return: 0 (no users yet)

-- Test 3: Check total table count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tables FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
-- Should return: 20+ tables

-- Test 4: List all tables (optional - just to see them)
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
-- Should show: analytics_events, challenges, comments, courses, etc.
```

**Results:**
- [ ] 4 schools visible (Ignition, Insight, Transformation, God Mode)
- [ ] Profiles table exists (0 rows is normal - no users yet)
- [ ] 20+ tables confirmed (analytics_events, challenges, comments, courses, etc.)
