At its core, a computer is a powerful machine that follows instructions to make all this possible.","key_terms_1":"Computer","key_terms_1_def":"An electronic device that processes data by following a set of instructions called programs.","key_terms_2":"Hardware","key_terms_2_def":"The physical parts of a computer, like the processor, memory, and storage devices.","core_concepts_1":"Computers Process Data by Following Instructions","core_concepts_1_def":"At the heart of a computer's function is its ability to process data—a collection of information like numbers or text—by executing instructions. These instructions come in the form of programs that tell the computer step-by-step what tasks to perform.","core_concepts_2":"Hardware and Software Work Together to Make Computing Possible","core_concepts_2_def":"The hardware is the tangible part of the computer you can touch, like the processor (CPU), memory, and storage devices. Software consists of the programs and operating systems that instruct the hardware how to operate. Neither hardware nor software alone can function as a computer; they must work together.","synthesis":"A computer is a system made up of hardware and software working in harmony. The hardware provides the physical machinery that processes data, while software gives the step-by-step instructions needed to perform tasks. Together, they transform raw data into meaningful results, enabling the broad range of activities we rely on every day.","connect_to_your_life":"Think about one activity you do daily on a computer or smartphone—whether it's sending a message, watching a video, or playing a game. What role do you think the hardware and software each play behind the scenes to make that activity happen?","key_takeaways_1":"A computer is an electronic device that processes data by executing instructions called programs.","key_takeaways_2":"Hardware (the physical parts) and software (the programs) must work together for a computer to function.","attached_to_chapter":"Fundamentals of Computing","attached_to_course":"Introduction to Computer Science","created_at":"2025-09-20 01:57:06.249675+00","updated_at":"2025-09-20 01:57:06.249675+00","chapter_id":"4bbaa4fd"}]
