## 🎓 Learning Resources

Since you're new to web development, here are concepts explained simply:

### What is Supabase?
- Think of it as a **super-powered database in the cloud**
- Stores all your app's data (users, courses, XP, etc.)
- Handles authentication (sign up/sign in)
- Has built-in security rules

### What is a Migration?
- A **set of instructions to create database tables**
- Like a recipe for building your database
- Can be run multiple times safely
- Keeps your database structure organized

### What is RLS (Row Level Security)?
- **Security rules that protect user data**
- Example: Users can only see their own progress
- Example: Only admins can delete courses
- Runs at database level (can't be bypassed!)

### What is an API Key?
- A **secret password** for your app to talk to Supabase
- Stored in `.env` file
- Never commit to git (kept secret!)
