# 🔧 Migration Fix - "profiles does not exist" Error

## ❌ The Problem

You got this error when running the migration:
```
ERROR: 42P01: relation "profiles" does not exist
```

## ✅ The Solution

I've created a **fixed version** of the migration that handles this properly.

---

## 🚀 Quick Fix

### Instead of running the original migration, run this:

**Use this file instead:** `supabase/migrations/001_core_platform_tables_fixed.sql`

### What I Fixed:

1. **Created tables WITHOUT foreign key constraints first**
2. **Added foreign key constraints AFTER all tables exist**
3. **This prevents the "profiles does not exist" error**

---

## 📋 Updated Steps

### Step 1: Create .env File (if not done)
```bash
# Mac/Linux:
./create-env.sh

# Windows:
create-env.bat
```

### Step 2: Run FIXED Migration

1. **Go to:** https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mbffycgrqfeesfnhhcdm/sql

2. **Run the FIXED migration:**
   - Open `supabase/migrations/001_core_platform_tables_fixed.sql`
   - Copy all content
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "RUN"
   - ✅ Should work without errors!

3. **Run Migration 2:**
   - Open `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
   - Copy all content
   - Paste into NEW query
   - Click "RUN"

4. **Run Migration 3:**
   - Open `supabase/migrations/003_functions_and_triggers.sql`
   - Copy all content
   - Paste into NEW query
   - Click "RUN"

### Step 3: Verify

In Supabase Table Editor, check:
- [ ] `schools` table has 4 rows
- [ ] `courses` table exists
- [ ] `posts` table exists
- [ ] All other tables exist

## 🎯 What Changed

### Original Migration (Broken):
```sql
-- This failed because it tried to reference profiles immediately
CREATE TABLE courses (
  teacher_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id), -- ❌ ERROR!
  ...
);
```

### Fixed Migration (Works):
```sql
-- Step 1: Create table without foreign key
CREATE TABLE courses (
  teacher_id UUID, -- ✅ No reference yet
  ...
);

-- Step 2: Add foreign key constraint after all tables exist
ALTER TABLE courses 
ADD CONSTRAINT courses_teacher_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES profiles(id); -- ✅ Works!
```

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

### If you get other errors:

**"Table already exists"**
- This is fine! The migration uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
- Just continue to the next migration

**"Constraint already exists"**
- This is fine! The migration uses `IF NOT EXISTS`
- Just continue

**"Permission denied"**
- Make sure you're logged into Supabase
- Try refreshing the page
