# ðŸš¨ Quick Fix for Dashboard Loading Issue

## **Problem**
The dashboard is stuck in loading state, likely due to:
1. Missing Mastery database tables
2. Potential RLS issues with schools table
3. Profile fetching problems

## **Immediate Fix Steps**

### 1. **Create Mastery Database Tables**
Run this SQL in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire contents of MASTERY_DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql
-- This will create all the Mastery system tables
```

### 2. **Check Browser Console**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for any error messages when the dashboard loads
4. Check for messages like:
   - "Error fetching schools: ..."
   - "Schools data loaded successfully: ..."

### 3. **Test Schools Table Access**
Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to test:

```sql
SELECT * FROM schools LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. **Check Profile Data**
Run this to see if your profile exists:

```sql
SELECT id, email, full_name, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

## **Expected Results**

After running the Mastery schema:
- âœ… Dashboard should load properly
- âœ… Schools should display (4 schools)
- âœ… Profile data should show
- âœ… Mastery page should work

## **If Still Having Issues**

1. **Check the browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify your Supabase connection** in the .env file
3. **Make sure you're signed in** with a valid account
4. **Try refreshing the page** after creating the tables

## **Debug Information**

The Dashboard now includes better error handling and will show:
- Specific error messages
- Loading states
- Retry buttons
- Console logging for debugging

**Next Steps:** Once the dashboard loads, you can test the Mastery system by navigating to the Mastery page!
