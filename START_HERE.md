# 🚀 START HERE - Complete Beginner's Guide

**Welcome! You're building The Human Catalyst University. Let's get your database set up!**

This guide assumes **zero technical knowledge**. Just follow each step exactly.

## ✨ What You Need to Do (Super Simple)

There are **2 main tasks**:

1. **Create a `.env` file** (stores your Supabase connection info)
2. **Run 3 SQL scripts** in Supabase (sets up your database)

That's it! Let's do it step by step.

## 📝 TASK 1: Create .env File (5 minutes)

### What is a .env file?
A `.env` file stores your secret keys and configuration. It's like a settings file for your app.

### How to Create It:

#### Method 1: Using Cursor/VS Code (Easiest)

1. **In Cursor/VS Code:**
   - Look at your file list on the left
   - Right-click in the empty space
   - Click **"New File"**
   - Name it exactly: `.env` (with the dot!)
   - Press Enter

2. **Copy and paste this into the file:**

```bash
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://mbffycgrqfeesfnhhcdm.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1iZmZ5Y2dycWZlZXNmbmhoY2RtIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTg5NTEwOTQsImV4cCI6MjA3NDUyNzA5NH0.vRB4oPdeQ4bQBns1tOLEzoS6YWY-RjrK_t65y2D0hTM
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=
REACT_APP_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
REACT_APP_SITE_NAME=The Human Catalyst University
REACT_APP_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

3. **Save the file** (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

4. **Done!** ✅

#### Method 2: Using Terminal (Mac/Linux)

```bash
# Go to your project folder
cd /Users/conesaleo/hcuniversity/hcuniversity

# Create the file
touch .env

# Open it with a text editor
open .env
```

Then paste the content above and save.

#### Method 3: Using Terminal (Windows)

```powershell
# Go to your project folder
cd C:\path\to\hcuniversity

# Create the file
type nul > .env

# Open it with Notepad
notepad .env
```

Then paste the content above and save.

## 🗄️ TASK 2: Run Database Migrations (10 minutes)

### What are migrations?
Migrations are SQL scripts that create tables in your database. Think of them as building instructions for your database structure.

### Step-by-Step:

#### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

1. Click this link: **https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/mbffycgrqfeesfnhhcdm**
2. Log in if needed
3. You should see your project dashboard

#### Step 2: Open SQL Editor

1. Look at the **left sidebar**
2. Find and click **"SQL Editor"** (looks like a `</>` icon)
3. You'll see a code editor

#### Step 3: Run Migration 1 (Core Tables)

1. **In Cursor/VS Code:**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/001_core_platform_tables.sql`
   - Press **Ctrl+A** (or Cmd+A on Mac) to select all
   - Press **Ctrl+C** (or Cmd+C) to copy

2. **In Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Click **"New Query"** button (top left)
   - **Ctrl+V** (or Cmd+V) to paste the SQL code
   - Click the big **"RUN"** button (or press F5)
   - **Wait for green success message** ✅

3. **You should see:**
   ```
   Success. No rows returned
   ```
   Or similar success message.

#### Step 4: Run Migration 2 (Security Policies)

1. **In Cursor/VS Code:**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
   - Select all (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)

2. **In Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Click **"New Query"** again (creates a fresh editor)
   - Paste the SQL code (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
   - Click **"RUN"** button
   - **Wait for success message** ✅

#### Step 5: Run Migration 3 (Functions & Triggers)

1. **In Cursor/VS Code:**
   - Open file: `supabase/migrations/003_functions_and_triggers.sql`
   - Select all (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C / Cmd+C)

2. **In Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Click **"New Query"** again
   - Paste the SQL code (Ctrl+V / Cmd+V)
   - Click **"RUN"** button
   - **Wait for success message** ✅

#### Step 6: Verify Everything Worked

1. In Supabase, click **"Table Editor"** (left sidebar)

2. You should now see these tables:
   - schools
   - constellation_families
   - constellations
   - courses
   - course_chapters
   - lessons
   - posts
   - comments
   - subscriptions
   - analytics_events
   - groups
   - challenges
   - quizzes
   - ...and more!

3. Click on **"schools"** table
   - You should see **4 rows**:
     1. Ignition
     2. Insight
     3. Transformation
     4. God Mode

4. **If you see this, you're done!** ✅

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the SQL Editor"
- Click the **hamburger menu** (☰) in top left
- Find **"SQL Editor"** in the menu

### "I get an error when running SQL"
- Make sure you ran migrations in order (1, 2, 3)
- Check if error says "already exists" - that's OK! It means it's already done
- Try refreshing the page and running again

### "I don't see any tables"
- Click "Table Editor" in left sidebar
- Make sure you're viewing the **"public"** schema
- Try refreshing the page

### "The .env file doesn't work"
- Make sure the file is named exactly `.env` (with the dot, no .txt extension)
- Make sure it's in the project root (same level as package.json)
- Make sure you saved the file after pasting content
- **Restart your development server** after creating .env
