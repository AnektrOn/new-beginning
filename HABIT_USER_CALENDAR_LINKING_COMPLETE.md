# ✅ Habit-User-Calendar Linking Implementation Complete

## 📋 Summary of Implementation

I have implemented complete linking between Habits, Users, and Calendar Events. Here's what was done:

---

## 🔗 1. Database Linking (Already Established)

### Tables and Relationships:
```
habits_library (id, title, description, xp_reward, frequency_type)
    ↓ (habit_id FK)
user_habits (id, user_id, habit_id, title, completion_count)
    ↓ (habit_id FK)
user_calendar_events (id, user_id, habit_id, title, event_date, is_completed)
    ↓ (habit_id FK)
user_habit_completions (id, user_id, habit_id, xp_earned, completed_at)
```

### Foreign Key Constraints:
- ✅ `user_habits.habit_id` → `habits_library.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- ✅ `user_calendar_events.habit_id` → `user_habits.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)  
- ✅ `user_habit_completions.habit_id` → `user_habits.id` (ON DELETE CASCADE)

## 🛠️ 2. Code Implementation

### A. Adding Habit from Library to User

**File:** `src/components/mastery/Habits.js`
**Function:** `handleAddHabitFromLibrary`

```javascript
const newHabit = await masteryService.addHabitToUser(user.id, {
  habit_id: habit.id,  // ← Links to habits_library
  title: habit.title,
  description: habit.description,
  frequency_type: habit.frequency_type,
  xp_reward: habit.xp_reward,
  is_custom: false
});
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates entry in `user_habits` with `habit_id` linking to library
2. Automatically calls `addHabitToCalendar` to create 30 calendar events
3. Updates UI state to show new habit

---

### B. Creating Calendar Events from Habit

**File:** `src/services/masteryService.js`
**Function:** `addHabitToCalendar`

```javascript
async addHabitToCalendar(userId, habitId, habitData) {
  const events = [];
  const today = new Date();
  
  // Create 30 days of events
  for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    events.push({
      user_id: userId,
      habit_id: habitId,  // ← Links to user_habits
      title: habitData.title,
      event_date: eventDate,
      xp_reward: habitData.xp_reward || 10
    });
  }
  
  await this.supabase
    .from('user_calendar_events')
    .insert(events);
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Creates 30 calendar events (one per day)
2. Each event has `habit_id` linking to `user_habits`
3. Events inherit XP reward from habit

---

### C. Fetching Calendar Events with Habit Information

**File:** `src/services/masteryService.js`  
**Function:** `getUserCalendarEvents`

```javascript
async getUserCalendarEvents(userId, dateRange = {}) {
  let query = this.supabase
    .from('user_calendar_events')
    .select(`
      *,
      user_habits(
        id,
        title,
        description,
        frequency_type,
        is_custom
      )
    `)
    .eq('user_id', userId);
  
  // Fallback if join fails (RLS issues)
  if (error) {
    // Try again without join
  }
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Fetches calendar events for user
2. LEFT JOIN with `user_habits` to get habit information
3. Falls back to simple query if join fails (RLS compatibility)
4. Returns events with nested `user_habits` object

---

### D. Displaying Habit Information in Calendar

**File:** `src/components/mastery/Calendar.js`
**Component:** Event card display

```javascript
{event.user_habits && (
  <div className="habit-info">
    <span className="habit-badge">
      📋 {event.user_habits.title}
    </span>
    <span className="frequency-badge">
      {event.user_habits.frequency_type}
    </span>
  </div>
)}
```

**What happens:**
1. Checks if event has linked habit data
2. Displays blue badge with habit name
3. Displays green badge with frequency type
4. Shows in event details sidebar

---

### E. Completing Calendar Event → Updates Habit

**File:** `src/services/masteryService.js`
**Function:** `completeCalendarEvent`

```javascript
async completeCalendarEvent(userId, eventId) {
  // Get event details
  const { data: event } = await this.supabase
    .from('user_calendar_events')
    .select('xp_reward, habit_id')
    .eq('id', eventId)
    .single();
  
  // Mark event as completed
  await this.supabase
    .from('user_calendar_events')
    .update({ is_completed: true })
    .eq('id', eventId);
  
  // If linked to habit, record completion
  if (event.habit_id) {
    await this.completeHabit(userId, event.habit_id);
  }
  
  // Award XP
  await this.awardXP(userId, event.xp_reward);
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Marks calendar event as completed
2. Calls `completeHabit` if event has `habit_id`
3. Creates entry in `user_habit_completions`
4. Increments `completion_count` in `user_habits`
5. Awards XP to user profile

---

### F. Deleting Calendar Event

**File:** `src/services/masteryService.js`
**Function:** `deleteCalendarEvent`

```javascript
async deleteCalendarEvent(userId, eventId) {
  const { error } = await this.supabase
    .from('user_calendar_events')
    .delete()
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .eq('id', eventId);
}
```

**What happens:**
1. Deletes event from database
2. UI automatically updates (state management)
3. Does NOT affect habit (only removes this event)

---

## 🎨 3. UI/UX Improvements

### Calendar Event Cards:
- ✅ Shows event title
- ✅ Shows habit name in blue badge (if linked)
- ✅ Shows frequency in green badge  
- ✅ Complete button (✅) for incomplete events
- ✅ Delete button (🗑️) for all events
- ✅ Visual distinction for completed events

### Calendar Day View:
- ✅ Events show on corresponding dates
- ✅ Tooltip shows habit name on hover
- ✅ Color coding: Yellow border = pending, Green border = completed
- ✅ Increased cell height to prevent overlapping

### Plus Button:
- ✅ Visible gradient button (white background, important!)
- ✅ Hover effects
- ✅ Clear and clickable

## 🧪 4. How to Test

### Test the Full Flow:

1. **Add Habit from Library**
   - Go to Mastery → Habits → "Habits Library (13)" tab
   - Click **+** button on "Morning Workout"
   - ✅ Should appear in "My Habits (1)" tab

2. **Check Calendar Events Created**
   - Go to Mastery → Calendar
   - ✅ Should see events for next 30 days with "Morning Workout" title
   - Click on today's date
   - ✅ Should see event with blue badge "📋 Morning Workout"

3. **Complete an Event**
   - Click ✅ button on an event
   - ✅ Event should show as completed (strikethrough)
   - ✅ XP should increase (check header)
   - Go back to Habits tab
   - ✅ "Morning Workout" completion_count should be 1

4. **Delete an Event**
   - Go to Calendar, click on any day
   - Click 🗑️ button on an event
   - ✅ Event should disappear from calendar

5. **Remove Habit (Cascade Test)**
   - Go to Habits → "My Habits" tab
   - Click 🗑️ button on "Morning Workout"
   - Go to Calendar
   - ✅ All "Morning Workout" events should be gone

## 🗄️ 5. Database Queries to Verify

### Check habit linking:
```sql
SELECT 
  uh.id,
  uh.title as user_habit_title,
  uh.habit_id,
  hl.title as library_habit_title,
  uh.completion_count
FROM user_habits uh
LEFT JOIN habits_library hl ON uh.habit_id = hl.id
WHERE uh.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

### Check calendar event linking:
```sql
SELECT 
  uce.id,
  uce.title as event_title,
  uce.event_date,
  uce.is_completed,
  uce.habit_id,
  uh.title as habit_title
FROM user_calendar_events uce
LEFT JOIN user_habits uh ON uce.habit_id = uh.id
WHERE uce.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY uce.event_date ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Check habit completions:
```sql
SELECT 
  uhc.id,
  uhc.completed_at,
  uhc.xp_earned,
  uh.title as habit_title,
  uh.completion_count
FROM user_habit_completions uhc
JOIN user_habits uh ON uhc.habit_id = uh.id
WHERE uhc.user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'
ORDER BY uhc.completed_at DESC;
```

## 🔍 8. Troubleshooting

### If calendar events don't show habit badges:
- Check browser console for join errors
- Look for "Error fetching calendar events with join"
- Fallback query should still return events (without badges)

### If habits don't create calendar events:
- Check that `addHabitToCalendar` is being called
- Look in `user_calendar_events` table for entries
- Verify `habit_id` column has values

### If completion doesn't update count:
- Check `completeCalendarEvent` is calling `completeHabit`
- Verify `user_habit_completions` has new entry
- Check `completion_count` in `user_habits` table
