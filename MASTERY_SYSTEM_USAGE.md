3. **user_habits** - User's personal habits collection
4. **user_toolbox_items** - User's personal tools collection

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Convert Button Not Working?

**Check:**
1. ✅ Are you logged in?
2. ✅ Are you on "My Tools" tab?
3. ✅ Is the tool in your personal collection?
4. ✅ Do you have an active internet connection?
5. ✅ Check browser console for errors

### Database Queries Failing?

**In Browser (with user logged in):**
- All queries should work
- RLS policies allow authenticated users

**In Node.js tests (no auth):**
- Read queries work (SELECT)
- Write queries fail (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- This is expected and secure

### Debug Logging:

Open browser console and look for:
- `📝 HabitsTabCompact:` - Habits component logs
- `🔧 ToolboxTabCompact:` - Toolbox component logs
- `✅` - Success messages
- `❌` - Error messages
