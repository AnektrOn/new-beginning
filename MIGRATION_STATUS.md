## ðŸ”„ NEXT STEPS: Run Remaining Migrations

You still need to run **3 more migration files** to complete the setup:

### 1. Add Foreign Key Constraints
**File:** `supabase/migrations/002_add_foreign_keys.sql`
- Links all tables together properly
- Adds referential integrity

### 2. Add Security Policies  
**File:** `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- User access controls

### 3. Add Helper Functions
**File:** `supabase/migrations/003_functions_and_triggers.sql`
- XP calculation functions
- Level-up triggers
- Progress tracking
